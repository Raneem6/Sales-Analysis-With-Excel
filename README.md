# 📊 Sales Analysis with Excel

This project is an interactive sales dashboard built entirely in **Microsoft Excel**, based on the same dataset used in my previous Power BI project:

## 🔁 Overview

The goal of this Excel version is to make the sales analysis accessible without needing specialized tools like Power BI. It uses built-in Excel features such as:

- Pivot Tables  
- Slicers  
- Dynamic Charts  

This makes the dashboard lightweight, easy to use, and portable.
